### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Elasticsearch Instability and Cluster Failures
---

This incident type refers to frequent or unexpected instability and cluster failures in Elasticsearch, which is a distributed search and analytics engine. These issues can impact the performance of the system, leading to downtime and potential data loss. The cause of these incidents can vary, including hardware failure, software bugs, network issues, or configuration errors. It is crucial to address these incidents quickly and efficiently to minimize the impact on the system and ensure its stability and reliability.

### Parameters
```shell
export ELASTICSEARCH_HOST="PLACEHOLDER"

export NODE_ID="PLACEHOLDER"

export INDEX_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export ERROR_MESSAGE="PLACEHOLDER"

export CLUSTER_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export NEW_NODE_COUNT="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Elasticsearch cluster health
```shell
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cluster/health?pretty'
```

### Check Elasticsearch cluster state
```shell
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cluster/state?pretty'
```

### Check Elasticsearch node stats
```shell
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_nodes/stats?pretty'
```

### Check Elasticsearch node info
```shell
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_nodes/${NODE_ID}/info?pretty'
```

### Check Elasticsearch index health
```shell
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cluster/health/${INDEX_NAME}?pretty'
```

### Check Elasticsearch index stats
```shell
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/${INDEX_NAME}/_stats?pretty'
```

### Check Elasticsearch shard allocation
```shell
curl -XGET '${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}:9200/_cat/allocation?v'
```

### Check Elasticsearch logs for errors
```shell
grep -i '${ERROR_MESSAGE}' /var/log/elasticsearch/${CLUSTER_NAME}.log
```

### Restart Elasticsearch service
```shell
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch.service
```

## Repair

### Consider adjusting the cluster configuration to improve performance and stability, such as changing the number of nodes, shards, or replicas, or adjusting the allocation of resources.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Set the Elasticsearch node count

NODE_COUNT=${NEW_NODE_COUNT}



# Stop the Elasticsearch service

sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch



# Update the Elasticsearch configuration file

sudo sed -i "s/#node\.max\_count\:/node\.max\_count\: $NODE_COUNT/g" /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml



# Start the Elasticsearch service

sudo systemctl start elasticsearch



# Verify that the node count has been updated

curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?v"


```
